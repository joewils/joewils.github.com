title: Winter Break LAX Challenge Spectacular
---

During the winter break we are going to combine the A and B team and focus on movement, passing, and shooting fundamentals with a series of partnered drills.  The two sessions are optional and will be geared towards having fun and team building.  

Each partnership will consist of an A-Team and a B-Team player chosen by the coaches at random.   

The first half will be a normal practice with warmup, star drill, overlap ground ball, overlap passing,  etcâ€¦

The second half of each practice will be geared toward drills that can be "scored" in some way as a partnership:

 * Face off
 * 2 vs 2 Ground Ball
 * 20 YD Sprint
 * 2 vs 2 Braveheart
 * 40 YD Pass on the Run
 * Pass / Shoot on Cage Drill
 * 4 vs 2 Box Keep Away
 * Etc...

Each session we will pick new partnerships and announce a winner.  The winning partnerships win bragging rights for the season.  

I will need some volunteers (3) to help shepard the boys between stations and assist with scoring.
