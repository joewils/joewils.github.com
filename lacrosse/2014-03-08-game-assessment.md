First I would like to express how proud I am of this group of young men.  Despite a crushing score of the first quarter (12-1) they put up a good fight with a never say die attitude.  We have an inspiring group of young men with good character and attitude.

### What Went Well

* Attitude.  No penalities.  Despite the score, our sons kept their cool and played a very honest game.
* Our goalie (Matt) had a heck of a game.  42 shots, 37 of them on goal, with 16 saves.  That is a very solid performance.
* Our middies did well at faceoffs considering most of them had never taken face during a game.
* Our shot on goal / scoring ratio is a solid 25%.  (4 shots on goal, 1 in the cage)

### This Weeks Focus

* Transition Defense, we need to transition to defense quicker, especially our middies and attack men.  During settled play our opponent rarely scored, however they exploited our middies overly aggressive offensive positioning and overtook our defenders with 5 vs 3 and sometimes 6 vs 3 situations.  Focusing on a 2-3-1 offense with 2 middies sitting high will provide better defensive coverage.
* Ground Balls, the key to defending a fast break is to not let it start.  Winning the ground ball is key. 
* Away from ball movement, on our clears too many of our players where rooted in spot and not giving our clearing defender an outlet.  As much as I love seeing a long pole make a run, passing is much more efficient.
* Passing with heads up play, too many times we attacked the goal and failed to utilize our attack men or cutting team mates. 

### Conclusion

Quoting one of the boys: "Losing Sucks!".  This game has given us a lot to work with.  We will improve and I'm confident our boys are up to the challenge.

#### Monday Practice will be at 4:00, starting Wednesday we will move to a 5:00 start time.

## Go Wildcats!
