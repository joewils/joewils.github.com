Coach rolls the ball out above the box as 2 offensive players stay above GLE and one attack goes to X. The players get the ball back to X, where the X man initiates offense. The X man must draw a man so that he creates a 2 v 1, leaving a teammate open on the crease.  Players not in the play form line in home alley.
