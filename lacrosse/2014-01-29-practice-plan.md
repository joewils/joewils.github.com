### Dodge and Shoot on Cage

4 lines radiating out from the cage.  Each line starts 20YDs out. Half way between start and cage is a second cone.  Player starts from the top, does a face dodge at the cone, immediatly takes a shot on cage. NO GOALIE!

### Push Triangle Drill

Three cones 10 to 15 yards apart in a triangle. Player at each cone. Player with ball attempts to "tag" other players for a point.  As the player moves towards a cone he "pushes" the other players.  30 seconds to score as many points as possible.

### Pull Triangle Drill

Three cones 10 to 15 yards apart in a triangle. Player at each cone. Two players without cone decide which way to run "pulling" the other players towards him.  If an off ball player tags the player with ball they each score a point. Off ball players MUST move in same direction at the same time.
