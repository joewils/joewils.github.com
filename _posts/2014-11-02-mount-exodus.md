### Movable Type to WordPress Web Application Utility

This happened over the weekend.  While working on a friends website over the summer I wrote a utility [class](https://github.com/joewils/ruby-mtexport/blob/master/mt_to_wordpress.rb) in Ruby to convert 1700 TypePad posts to WordPress. 

This weekend I wanted to give Sinatra web development a go, and the result is the following web application: [Mount Exodus](http://www.mtexodus.com).
