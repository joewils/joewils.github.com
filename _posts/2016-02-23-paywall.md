Isoroku Yamamoto wrote an excellent [article](http://elaineou.com/2016/02/19/how-to-use-chrome-extensions-to-bypass-paywalls/) explaining how many newspaper websites are "open" to Google and other webcrawlers but closed off with a paywall for us regular folks.

I've packaged up the code used to demonstrate the process and deployed it to Github.

Enjoy.
