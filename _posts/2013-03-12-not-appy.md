UK government position on app development vs. mobile web: [http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/03/12/were-not-appy-not-appy-at-all/](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/03/12/were-not-appy-not-appy-at-all/)

1. Is our web service already designed to be responsive to different screen sizes? If not, why not?
2. What is the user need that only a native/hybrid app can meet?
3. Are there existing native/hybrid apps which already meet this user need?
4. Is our service available to 3rd parties via an API or open data? If not, why not?
5. Does meeting this need justify the lifetime cost of a native or hybrid app?
