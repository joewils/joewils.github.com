*[https://github.com/ryanb/cancan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan)

Also stumbled upon these relevent tutorial projects:

*[https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan)
*[https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-prelaunch-signup](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-prelaunch-signup)

I'm really enjoying ruby development.  Reminds me of my early career developing in Perl.  So much good stuff from the community.
