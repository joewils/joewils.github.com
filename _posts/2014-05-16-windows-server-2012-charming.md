Today I learned that the damn side bar thingy in Windows 8 / Windows Server 2012 has a name: "Charms Bar"

If you've ever struggled for two minutes to get the damn thing to trigger when using RDP, you'll understand how "Charming" it really is.

FYI, on a Mac keybord the "Command Key" is the equivalent to the "Windows Key"

* Windows Key + C - Opens Charms bar
* Windows Key + D - Switch to desktop (from start screen)
* Windows Key + E - Opens file explorer
* Windows Key + F - Search (files and folders)
* Windows Key + H - Share
* Windows Key + I - Settings
* Windows Key + Q - Global search
* Windows Key + Y - Shows desktop screen
* Windows Key + W - System settings search
* Windows Key + X - Quick access menu
* Windows Key + Z - Opens app bar
