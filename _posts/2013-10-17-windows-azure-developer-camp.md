I'll be attending the October 24th developer camp for Windows Azure:

* [Make It Happen In The Cloud](http://www.microsoft.com/enterprise/events/make-it-happen.htm#fbid=HggerXrthXA)
* [Event Registration](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032561398&Culture=en-US&community=0)

> All languages are welcome. With Windows Azure, you can use practically any language, framework, or tool to build or move existing applications into the cloud.
