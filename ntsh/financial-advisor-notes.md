### Propriety CMS Concerns

* How easy is it to export content?
* How easy is it to export/retrieve media assets?

Drupal and WordPress have well documented content and media export capabilities.  Should you choose to leave either platform, systems and process' are already established.

## Email

* $4/month/user [Exchange Online](https://products.office.com/en-US/exchange/exchange-online)
* $4/month/user [Exchange Archiving](https://products.office.com/en-us/exchange/microsoft-exchange-online-archiving-email)

Microsoft is really pushing to dominate hosted email.  At $8/month/user I can't recommend any other solution.  Wow!

## WordPress Hosting

* $25/month [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/#plans)
* $35...$115/month [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/plans/)

### Managed WordPress hosting limitations: 

All of the providers limit revision storage to ~25 edits.  This would push your website out of compliance for SEC purposes. 

## JoeCode Managed WordPress Hosting?

This is a business idea I've been contemplating for several years now.  I can take my experience administering Linux servers, crafting websites, and managing WordPress to build a service based business.

1. Dedicated Virtual Private Server (VPS). Both WordPress.com and WP Engine use a shared hosting environment.  
2. Amazon infrastructure.  I'll use the best provider for provisioning resources.
3. Unlimited revisions. This should cover your website from a compliance perspective.
4. Consistent backups and backup storage.
5. Manage all security updates
6. SSL certificate management and provisioning
7. Etc...

Obviously there is a lot of stuff to sort out on my end.  Price being one of them.  I need to research what my hard costs would be.  (Primarily Amazon EC2(hosting) and S3(backup storage))
